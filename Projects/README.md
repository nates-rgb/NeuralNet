Hold the projects


Alright I am sorry about the mess, project 2 will have its own folder. The report and code are all one notebook called proj1.pynb at the bottom there is a general overview of the project, but inbetween most if not all code sections are some in the moment thoughts and reactions to the results of the code. Also there may be alot of spelling errors as I was working on this unitl around 11:25pm give or take.
